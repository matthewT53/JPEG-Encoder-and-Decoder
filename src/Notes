To clear confusion, just in case.
Width: X direction
Height: Y direction
Image is not down sampled for simplicity, will add this later

Chroma subsampling:

Algorithm: Quantization quality factor
1 < Q < 100 ( quality range );
s = (Q < 50) ? 5000/Q : 200 - 2Q;
Ts[i] (element in new quan table) = ( S * Tb[i] ( element in original quan table ) + 50 ) / 100;

Note:
* when Q = 50 there is no change
* the higher q is, the larger the file size
* Need to level shift before CHROMA SUBSAMPLE

Things to do:
* add down sampling (might need to), current setting is 4:4:4
* instead of freeing everything at once, free resources when we no longer require them
* lots of magic numbers
* Some of the jpeg images encoded by this program still has barely noticeable lines and columns.

Making the program more efficient:
Encoder:
* Implement the fast DCT algorithm
* Find a better method to encode the DC and AC values

Bugs and things to work on:
Chroma Subsampling not working correctly:
* Verified that the JPEG bytes are being set correctly
* Could be the chroma subsampling algorithm
* SOLVED: Level shifting must be done before chroma subsampling
* 4:2:0 is not working properly
